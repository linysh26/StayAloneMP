Loved you once and again.
我一次又一次的爱上你
I'd become just your plaything.
甚至已经成为你的玩物
Nothing had mattered that night
一个风平浪静的夜晚
And I realize I had been pulled by your whims.
我意识到我只是被你的幻想驱使
This gravity is crushing me.
重力撕扯着我
The exit's not here and so much doubt falls on me.
无路可逃，无数问题困扰着我
No matter how or when I shout,
无论何时我怎样的呼喊
I wonder if I can be heard.
我想知道能否得到答案
I'm breaking down,
我已经快要崩溃
And no one understands
但没人能够理解
That I'm lost in some abyss.
我只能迷失在深渊中
It's getting dark
如此黑暗
And panic's setting in.
恐惧袭来
I am faced with the end of the world.
我曾面对着世界的终焉
I just can't understand.
只是无法理解
Deep inside, there is wanting.
内心深处，为何仍怀抱希望
Sounds that I've all but shut out
我曾经的呼唤都被我弃之门外
Echoes hollow, unbound. Now I am trapped in a mist.
空洞的回音，脱离控制，我陷入这薄雾中
This heaviness is drowning me.
这份负担淹没了我
I'm slow, can't control the actions I am fighting.
我缓慢的，无法控制的战斗着
I'm grasping at distorted glass.
紧握这扭曲的镜子
I wonder if I can be seen.
我能否看到呢？
I can't stop myself from looking behind from the end,
我无法抑制地在这终点回首
Reaching around so blindingly till I start to bend.
不断向前，直到我开始扭曲
And I'm standing, surrounded, so close to the edge.
矗立着，环顾四周，距离边缘近在咫尺
Tumbling down forever, will I ever find any solace?
不断坠落，我是否得到过安慰？
I've fallen behind in this revolving city.
我被这旋转的城市遗落
Reality is like a dream.
现实却变得像梦
I wonder if I can exist.
不知道我是否能继续存在
I can't stop myself from looking behind from the end,
我无法抑制地在这终点回首
This sight I see is confusing me.
我看到的景象却令我迷惑
I've fallen behind in this revolving city.
我被这旋转的城市遗落
Reality is like a dream.
现实如同梦境
I wonder if I can exist.
不知道我是否能继续存在
I can't stop myself from looking behind from the end,
我无法抑制地在这终点回首
Reaching around so blindingly till I start to bend.
不断向前，直到我开始扭曲
And I'm standing, surrounded, so close to the edge.
矗立着，环顾四周，距离边缘近在咫尺
Tumbling down forever, will I ever find any solace?

Even as I fall,
即使我在坠落
I'll spread my wings and soar.
我也要展开我的翅膀飞翔
And I know it's not the end.
我知道还未结束
It's breaking out.
一切都爆发了
This feeling's setting in.
这种感觉不断的涌来
I am faced with a sudden silence.
眼前的一切却突然回归沉寂
